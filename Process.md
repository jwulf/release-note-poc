# Process

How am I going to manage this for the 8.3.0 release?

I need to track all the issues, and each issue through the process.

One idea:

Use a BPMN process to manage each issue. 

So, create a JSON structure from the [releases page](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform/releases).

Push these issues into a JSON database. Then start a new process instance for each issue.
